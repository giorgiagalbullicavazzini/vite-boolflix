# GalFlix

## Features

The purpose of this web app is to emulate the behavior of a streaming website. Searching for a movie or a tv show, the app returns the different proper results contained in the API we decided to use. Each result is contained in a standard card displaying on hover the different movie or tv show info: title, original title, original language, average vote and synopsis.

## Future releases

- The original title gets displayed only if different from the selected language's title;
- The chance to load more results when reaching the last one available on the page;
- When searching for another movie or tv show, the container scrollbar gets a reset;
- Adding more info to the card, such as actors and actresses and the movie or tv show genres;
- Adding a genre filter to display only the proper movies and tv shows;
- When the page gets loaded, the API displays a selection of movies and tv shows with high popularity and then, after research, this selection gets deleted and the container begins to display the proper results.
